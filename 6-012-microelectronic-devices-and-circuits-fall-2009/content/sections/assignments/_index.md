|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Design problem answer sheet {{< br >}}{{< br >}} The performance parameters of your design should be entered on this answer sheet in the spaces provided, and the sizes and bias level currents and voltages of all of the transistors (assuming the quiescent output voltage is zero Volts) should also be entered on the answer sheet. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  | ([XLS](/coursemedia/6-012-microelectronic-devices-and-circuits-fall-2009/f9c12dc956942483a867c65c84476920_design_sheet.xls)) |
|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Spring 2006 design problem {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Slides prepared for the Spring 2006 6.012 students to accompany that semester's design problem. The circuit has similarities with this semester's design problem, and you may find these slides to be useful. The circuit details, device parameters, and performance specifications are different in the two design problems, but the slides are relevant just the same. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  | ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit6_012f09_design_s06))
