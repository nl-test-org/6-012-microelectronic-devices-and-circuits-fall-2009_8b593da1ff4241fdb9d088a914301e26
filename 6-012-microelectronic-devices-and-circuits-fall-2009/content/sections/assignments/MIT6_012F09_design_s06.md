description: Slides prepared for the Spring 2006 6.012 students to accompany that
  semester's design problem. The circuit has similarities with this semester's design
  problem, and you may find these slides to be useful. The circuit details, device
  parameters, and performance specifications are different in the two design problems,
  but the slides are relevant just the same.
